            <p>The "difficulty" of Linux often lies not in the commands themselves
but in whether you have a clear system map: why it's suited for servers,
what its multi-user/multi-task and permission models mean in daily
operations, what commonalities and differences exist across
distributions in package management and directory layout, and what to do
after your first login. This post serves as the <strong>entry
guide</strong> for the entire Linux series. I'll first establish core
concepts, then walk you through the most commonly used commands covering
"file navigation—viewing and editing—remote connections—basic
permissions and users." The goal is not to pile up a command reference
but to take you from "able to log in" to "having a basic sense of
direction"—each topic is <strong>introduced briefly</strong>, then
you're guided to corresponding deep-dive articles (Disk Management, File
Permissions, User Management, Service Management, Process Management,
Package Management, Advanced File Operations). Afterward, learning any
specialized topic will be much smoother.</p>

<h1 id="core-linux-philosophy-why-learn-it-why-its-designed-this-way">Core
Linux Philosophy: Why Learn It, Why It's Designed This Way</h1>
<h2 id="why-choose-linux-especially-for-servers">Why Choose Linux
(Especially for Servers)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Highly Customizable</strong>: Open-source and free to use;
all components can be modified or customized as needed. If you need to
slim down a system, customize the kernel, or optimize for specific
hardware, Linux is the most flexible choice.</li>
<li><strong>Stable and Reliable</strong>: Linux is widely used in
servers, embedded systems, and more, with strong stability and fault
tolerance. Many critical systems (finance, telecommunications, cloud
platforms) run Linux, with uptime reaching years without reboots.</li>
<li><strong>Powerful Ecosystem</strong>: Built-in powerful package
managers and rich open-source software resources, such as
<code>apt</code> (Debian/Ubuntu), <code>yum</code>/<code>dnf</code>
(RHEL/CentOS). Most tools you need (databases, web servers, monitoring
tools, development languages) can be installed directly via package
managers without hunting down installers.</li>
<li><strong>Everything is a File</strong>: The filesystem abstracts
various devices, allowing unified access to disks, network devices, and
peripherals. This design philosophy makes Linux interfaces very
consistent: whether reading disk data, viewing process information, or
configuring networks, you're "reading and writing files." This
consistency makes automation scripts very simple.</li>
<li><strong>Command-Line First, but GUIs Exist</strong>: Many operations
are more efficient via CLI (Command Line Interface), making remote
management and batch operations highly effective. Server environments
predominantly use command lines, but if you want a graphical interface
(like desktop Linux), many distributions provide out-of-the-box
GNOME/KDE desktops.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="common-distributions-a-brief-comparison-which-to-choose">Common
Distributions: A Brief Comparison (Which to Choose?)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ubuntu/Debian Family</strong>: Package manager is
<code>apt</code>, active community, rich documentation, suitable for
beginners and developers. Ubuntu LTS (Long Term Support) is a common
choice for cloud servers.</li>
<li><strong>CentOS/RHEL Family</strong>: Package manager is
<code>yum</code> or <code>dnf</code> (CentOS 8+ / RHEL 8+), suitable for
production environments, good stability, strong enterprise support.
CentOS Stream is upstream of RHEL; AlmaLinux / Rocky Linux are community
alternatives to CentOS.</li>
<li><strong>SUSE Family</strong>: Uses <code>zypper</code>, common in
enterprise environments and SAP-related deployments, popular in European
enterprises.</li>
<li><strong>Arch Linux</strong>: Rolling release model, newest software
versions, but higher requirements for operators (needs manual
configuration of many things). Suitable for users who enjoy tinkering
and pursuing the latest software.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Practical Selection Advice</strong>: - For learning or
development, recommend <strong>Ubuntu LTS</strong> (abundant docs,
active community). - For enterprise production environments, recommend
<strong>RHEL family</strong> (RHEL / AlmaLinux / Rocky Linux, stable
with commercial support). - For cloud servers, check cloud provider
recommendations (AWS recommends Amazon Linux, Alibaba Cloud recommends
Alibaba Cloud Linux, but Ubuntu and CentOS families are also
well-supported).</p>
<h2 id="three-core-linux-principles-understanding-these-makes-many-design-choices-less-strange">Three
Core Linux Principles (Understanding These Makes Many Design Choices
Less Strange)</h2>
<h3 id="multi-user-multi-task">1. Multi-User, Multi-Task</h3>
<p>Multiple users can log in simultaneously (via SSH, tty, etc.), and
each user can run multiple tasks (processes) in parallel. This differs
from Windows' typical "only one user at a time" scenario—on a Linux
server, dozens of users might be running different tasks simultaneously,
and the system needs to isolate their permissions, resources, and
files.</p>
<p>This is why Linux's permission model is so strict: you can't casually
view others' files or kill their processes.</p>
<h3 id="permission-mechanism-file-centric">2. Permission Mechanism:
File-Centric</h3>
<p>Linux permission management centers on <strong>files (including
directories)</strong>, using <strong>read (r), write (w), execute
(x)</strong> permissions and combinations of <strong>owner / group /
others</strong> to manage access control.</p>
<p>Each file has three permission groups (owner / group / others), each
with rwx three bits, determining "who can do what." For example: -
<code>rwxr-xr-x</code>: owner can read/write/execute, group and others
can read/execute but not write. - <code>rw-------</code>: owner can
read/write, group and others can't do anything (common for private key
files like <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Why this design?</strong> Because Linux is a multi-user
system; without permission control, anyone could delete others' files or
modify system configurations, causing chaos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In-depth content on permissions (SUID/SGID/Sticky bit, ACL, umask,
etc.) is covered in the <strong>《Linux File Permissions》</strong>
specialized article; here you only need to know the basics.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="everything-is-a-file-unified-abstraction-interface">3.
Everything is a File (Unified Abstraction Interface)</h3>
<p>In Linux, almost everything is abstracted as a "file," including: -
Regular files (text, binary, scripts) - Directories (also a special kind
of file) - Devices (<code>/dev/sda</code> is the first SCSI/SATA hard
drive, <code>/dev/tty</code> is terminal) - Process information (under
<code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/</code> you can see various process info) -
System information (under <code>/sys/</code> you can see hardware device
tree) - Pipes, sockets (inter-process communication can also be through
"files")</p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: Consistent interface. You can use the same
commands (<code>cat</code>, <code>echo</code>, <code>&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;</code>, etc.) to operate on files, devices, and process
information. For example: - <code>cat /proc/cpuinfo</code> to view CPU
info - <code>echo 1 &gt; /sys/class/leds/led0/brightness</code> to
control LED brightness -
<code>cat /dev/urandom | head -c 16 &gt; random.bin</code> to generate
random numbers</p>
<p>This consistency makes Linux automation scripts very powerful.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="first-login-what-should-you-do">First Login: What Should You
Do</h1>
<p>Suppose you've received SSH login info for a Linux server (IP,
username, password). After your first login, you should:</p>
<h2 id="confirm-your-identity-and-permissions">1. Confirm Your Identity
and Permissions</h2>
<p>After logging in, look at the command prompt: -
<code>root@hostname ~ #</code>: You're the root user (superuser,
unlimited permissions), prompt is <code>#</code>. -
<code>user@hostname ~ $</code>: You're a regular user, prompt is
<code>$</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Security Recommendation</strong>: Don't log in directly as
root for daily operations. Use a regular user account and use
<code>sudo</code> when permissions are needed. Reasons: - Root
permissions are too broad; one <code>rm -rf /</code> can delete the
entire system (although many modern systems block such dangerous
commands, the risk is still high). - Logs show which user executed which
<code>sudo</code> command, but if everyone logs in as root, you can't
tell who did what.</p>

<p><strong>Safety Tip</strong>: <code>rm -rf</code> is a dangerous
command, especially <code>rm -rf /</code> (deletes entire system root
directory). Modern Linux blocks such commands, but still be careful.
<strong>Before deleting, use <code>ls</code> to confirm what you're
deleting.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Files deleted by <code>rm</code> can actually be recovered
(filesystems are journaled, with backup and recovery mechanisms). To
thoroughly shred a file (overwrite with random data), use
<code>shred filename</code>, but this is dangerous and not recommended
for daily use.</p>

<p><strong>Tips</strong>: - If you <code>ssh</code> to another machine
within an SSH session (nested SSH), <code>exit</code> only exits the
current level; you need multiple <code>exit</code> to get back to local.
- If network drops, SSH session will hang; you can use <code>~.</code>
(tilde + dot) to force disconnect (must be entered at the start of a new
line).</p>
<h2 id="password-free-login-key-authentication">3. Password-Free Login
(Key Authentication)</h2>
<p><strong>Why use key login?</strong> - More secure (key length

convenient (don't need to enter password every time) - Can be paired
with automation scripts (like Ansible, Fabric)</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong>: 1. Generate key pair locally (public key +

<h2 id="changing-ssh-port-security-hardening">5. Changing SSH Port
(Security Hardening)</h2>
<p>Default port <code>22</code> is a prime target for hacker scans;
changing the port reduces scan probability (but isn't absolute
security).</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong>: 1. Edit config file: <figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure> 2. Find
<code>#Port 22</code>, uncomment and change to another port (like
<code>Port 22222</code>) 3. Restart SSH service: <figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo systemctl restart sshd  <span class="comment"># Systemd systems</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># or</span></span><br><span class="line">sudo service sshd restart  <span class="comment"># SysV systems</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure> 4.

<p><strong>Security Recommendations</strong>: - Changing port only
reduces scan probability; doesn't prevent targeted attacks. - More
important security measures: <strong>disable password login, only allow
key login</strong>, <strong>configure firewall (only allow specific IPs
to connect to SSH)</strong>, <strong>install fail2ban (automatically ban
brute-force attack IPs)</strong>.</p>

and User Basics (Brief Introduction, See Specialized Articles for Deep
Dive)</h1>
<h2 id="permission-basics-what-does-rwx-mean">1. Permission Basics: What
Does rwx Mean</h2>
<p>Each file/directory has three permission groups (owner / group /
others), each with three bits (rwx): - <strong>r (read)</strong>: Can
read - <strong>w (write)</strong>: Can write - <strong>x
(execute)</strong>: Can execute (for directories, x means can enter that
directory)</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: <code>-rw-r--r--</code> - First character
<code>-</code> indicates regular file (<code>d</code> indicates
directory, <code>l</code> indicates symbolic link) - <code>rw-</code>:
owner can read and write, not execute - <code>r--</code>: group can
read, not write or execute - <code>r--</code>: others can read, not
write or execute</p>

<p><strong>Numeric Notation</strong> (most commonly used): -

<code>5 = r-x</code> (4+1) - <code>4 = r--</code> -
<code>0 = ---</code></p>

<li><strong><code>/etc</code></strong>: Main system configuration file
directory. Almost all service configs are here (like
<code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, <code>/etc/fstab</code>,
<code>/etc/hosts</code>)</li>
<li><strong><code>/var</code></strong>: Variable data directory
<ul>
<li><code>/var/log</code>: System and service log files (like
<code>/var/log/syslog</code>, <code>/var/log/auth.log</code>)</li>
<li><code>/var/www</code>: Web server website root directory
(Apache/Nginx default)</li>
</ul></li>

<p><strong><code>kill</code> vs <code>kill -9</code></strong>: -
<code>kill</code>: Sends <code>SIGTERM</code> signal; process can catch
this signal, do some cleanup (like saving data, closing connections)
before exiting. - <code>kill -9</code>: Sends <code>SIGKILL</code>
signal; process cannot catch it, immediately forcefully terminated (may
cause data loss or resource leaks).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: First use <code>kill</code>; if
process doesn't respond, then use <code>kill -9</code>.</p>

<h2 id="keep-a-backup-connection-when-modifying-networkssh-config">2.
Keep a Backup Connection When Modifying Network/SSH Config</h2>
<p>If you modify network or SSH config within an SSH session, messing up
might lock yourself out. <strong>Correct approach</strong>: - Keep one
SSH session open (to restore config) - Open a new SSH session to test if
modification works - If new session can't connect, immediately restore
config in old session</p>
<h2 id="think-thrice-before-executing-dangerous-commands">3. Think
Thrice Before Executing Dangerous Commands</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>rm -rf /</code>: Delete entire system root directory (modern
Linux blocks this, but still be careful)</li>
<li><code>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda</code>: Write zeros to entire hard
drive (data unrecoverable)</li>
<li><code>chmod -R 777 /</code>: Change entire system permissions to
anyone can read/write/execute (security disaster)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong>: - Before deleting, use
<code>ls</code> to confirm what you're deleting - Before disk operations
(<code>dd</code>, <code>fdisk</code>, <code>mkfs</code>), first confirm
device name (<code>lsblk</code>) - Before modifying permissions, think
through why and what to change to</p>
<h2 id="logs-are-your-friend">4. Logs Are Your Friend</h2>
<p>When problems arise, check logs first: - <code>/var/log/syslog</code>
(Debian/Ubuntu) or <code>/var/log/messages</code> (RHEL/CentOS): System
log - <code>/var/log/auth.log</code> (Debian/Ubuntu) or
<code>/var/log/secure</code> (RHEL/CentOS): Authentication log (SSH
logins, sudo operations) - <code>/var/log/&lt;service-name&gt;/</code>:
Individual service logs (like <code>/var/log/nginx/</code>,
<code>/var/log/mysql/</code>)</p>

<h1 id="next-steps-where-to-deep-dive">Next Steps: Where to Deep
Dive</h1>
<p>This article is the <strong>entry guide</strong> for the entire Linux
series; each topic is just "briefly introduced." If you want to dive
deeper into any topic, check the corresponding specialized article:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>《Linux File Permissions》</strong>: SUID/SGID/Sticky bit,
ACL, umask, permission inheritance, etc.</li>
<li><strong>《Linux User Management》</strong>:
<code>useradd/usermod/userdel</code>, group management,
<code>/etc/passwd</code>, <code>/etc/shadow</code>, sudo configuration,
etc.</li>
<li><strong>《Linux Disk Management》</strong>: Partitioning (MBR/GPT,
<code>fdisk</code>/<code>gdisk</code>), formatting (<code>mkfs</code>),
mounting (<code>mount</code>, <code>/etc/fstab</code>), LVM, RAID,
etc.</li>
<li><strong>《Linux System Service Management》</strong>: Systemd
(<code>systemctl</code>), SysV (<code>service</code>,
<code>chkconfig</code>), custom services, auto-start on boot, etc.</li>
<li><strong>《Linux Package Management》</strong>:
<code>apt</code>/<code>yum</code>/<code>dnf</code> in-depth usage,
compilation installation, <code>.rpm</code>/<code>.deb</code> manual
installation, software source configuration, etc.</li>
<li><strong>《Linux Process and Resource Management》</strong>:
CPU/memory/disk IO monitoring,
<code>top</code>/<code>htop</code>/<code>iotop</code>,
<code>nice</code>/<code>renice</code>, <code>cgroup</code>, OOM killer,
etc.</li>
<li><strong>《Linux Advanced File Operations》</strong>: Pipes
(<code>|</code>), redirection (<code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;</code>, <code>2&gt;</code>), stdin/stdout/stderr,
<code>xargs</code>, <code>tee</code>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Learning Recommendations</strong>: 1. First read through this
"Basics" article to establish overall awareness. 2. Based on your actual
needs, choose corresponding specialized topics for deep learning (for
example, if you need to configure disks, see 《Disk Management》; if you
need to configure services, see 《System Service Management》). 3. Learn
by doing; best to have a virtual machine or cloud server for practice
(recommend VirtualBox + Ubuntu or Alibaba Cloud/Tencent Cloud student
instances).</p>

<p><strong>By this point, you should have progressed from "able to log
in" to "having a basic sense of direction." Next is to choose
corresponding specialized topics for deep learning based on actual
needs. Remember: Linux isn't learned all at once but accumulated
continuously through practice.</strong></p>
